# No Rest for the Wicked
A Fabric mod that removes the player's ability to sleep in a bed. I was inspired to make this mod after watching [Dialko's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=netOt6_D-W4) on the topic.
## Features
- Players can no longer skip the night
- Players can no longer set their spawnpoint in the Overworld (Respawn Anchors can still be used in the Nether)
- Phantoms will no longer spawn by default (they can be temporarily re-enabled by setting the doInsomnia gamerule to True)
- Drowned have a 25% chance of dropping phantom membranes when killed by a player [as of 1.0.1]
- Beds will no longer explode in the Nether or the End
## Planned features
- Allow beds, or something like a bed, to be used by the player towards the endgame
- Reimplement phantoms in a more useful way
- Support custom user configuration (e.g. ability to disable certain features)
- Support for NeoForge (modern) and Forge (legacy)
- Support for older versions of Minecraft
  - 1.21.1 (Fabric/NeoForge)
  - 1.20.1 (Fabric/NeoForge)
  - 1.12.2 (Forge)
  - 1.7.10 (Forge)
